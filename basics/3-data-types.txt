GO supports the following data types:

1) Integers (int):
	a) Whole numbers: int, int8, int16, int32, int64)
	b) Positive whole numbers (uint8, uint16, uint21, uint64, uintptr)
2) Floating point numbers (float32, float64)
3) Complex numbers (complex64, complex128)
4) Booleans (true, false)
5) Strings (string)

NOTE: It's better to always stick to "default" data types, which are int, uint, and float64

There are also many other data type in GO, which we will take a look at later
